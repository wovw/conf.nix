# Verified Flake Update Pipeline

This repository updates `flake.lock` from pewter and merges only revisions
that pass the Build gate for every host. The design rationale is in
`docs/adr/0009-flake-update-pipeline.md`; this document is the operational
runbook and implementation reference. Host names are intentionally not
enumerated here: the gate builds every `nixosConfigurations.<host>` entry,
the Deployer verifies every `build <host>` check, and
`docs/agents/adding-a-host.md` covers adding a host.

## Pipeline

The sequence is:

1. `flake-updater.timer` runs Mondays around 02:00 on pewter with persistence and a 30-minute
   randomized delay.
2. `flake-updater.service` runs as the configured pewter user, updates a
   clone in `/var/lib/flake-updater`, and maintains one `flake-update` branch
   and pull request.
3. GitHub Actions runs `.github/workflows/build-gate.yml` for every pull
   request. It builds every host's toplevel closure, one `build <host>` check
   per host.
4. GitHub auto-merge is enabled by the Updater, but merge waits for all
   required `build <host>` checks to pass.
5. `flake-deployer.timer` runs Mondays around 06:00 on pewter with persistence and a
   30-minute randomized delay.
6. `flake-deployer.service` verifies the merged revision, switches pewter,
   runs the health gate, and pushes the deployed closure to the fleet Attic
   cache.
7. `.github/workflows/watchdog.yml` runs on the 1st of each month at 09:00 UTC and fails when
   the latest `flake.lock` commit is more than thirty days old.

## Updater

The Updater reads the GitHub token from the SOPS secret
`github_token`. It keeps GitHub's credential helper in the updater checkout's
`.gitconfig`, rather than changing the user's Home Manager-managed global Git
configuration. It also sets the commit identity explicitly.

Each run resets the local branch to `origin/main`, rebases an existing
`origin/flake-update` branch onto it, and runs `nix flake update`. If
`flake.lock` is unchanged, it exits successfully without pushing. Otherwise
it commits `flake.lock`, force-pushes `flake-update` with lease protection,
creates the PR if absent, and requests rebase auto-merge.

The updater disables recursive submodule fetching during `git fetch`. This is
required because the repository's submodule URL uses GitHub SSH syntax while
the service environment is intended to authenticate through HTTPS and the
GitHub token.

Manual operation:

```sh
ssh pewter 'systemctl status flake-updater.timer'
ssh pewter 'flake-updater --dry-run'
ssh pewter 'sudo systemctl start flake-updater.service'
ssh pewter 'sudo journalctl -u flake-updater.service -n 100 --no-pager'
```

Use `--dry-run` before investigating an unexpected update. It prints the
`flake.lock` diff and does not push, create a PR, or enable auto-merge.

## Build Gate

The Build gate builds each system's full toplevel closure:

```sh
nix build ".#nixosConfigurations.<host>.config.system.build.toplevel"
```

The matrix in `.github/workflows/build-gate.yml` has one job per host with a
runner matching the host platform. The workflow initializes submodules after rewriting
GitHub SSH URLs to HTTPS and uses the public fleet Attic cache for
substitution. Successful same-repository PR builds push their closure to
that cache.

When a check fails, inspect the specific job log before changing the
pipeline. A PR must have every `build <host>` check successful before it is eligible for
auto-merge.

## Deployer

The Deployer uses `/var/lib/flake-deployer` and reads the SOPS GitHub token
plus the SOPS Attic cache token. It fetches `main` with submodule recursion
disabled (the user gitconfig sets `submodule.recurse=true`, so the fetch and
checkout pass `-c submodule.recurse=false`), then initializes submodules with
this rewrite:

```text
git@github.com: -> https://github.com/
```

If the pinned submodule commit is not on any upstream branch (e.g. after an
upstream amend/force-push), the first submodule update fails; the Deployer
then fetches each pinned submodule SHA explicitly and retries once.

Before switching, it:

1. Resolves the pull request associated with the current `main` commit.
2. Reads that PR's `headRefOid`.
3. Checks every `build <host>` check-run on that head commit.
4. Stops if the merged commit has no associated PR, no `build <host>` checks
   exist, or any such check is absent or unsuccessful.

The check lookup uses the PR head commit because a rebase merge creates a new
main commit that may not have its own GitHub check runs.

The switch uses NixOS's setuid wrapper, not the unprivileged `sudo` binary in
the Nix store:

```sh
/run/wrappers/bin/sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake ".?submodules=1#pewter"
```

The service records `/run/current-system` before switching. If the rebuild
fails, it switches back to that generation. After a successful switch it
requires:

- `tailscale status` to succeed
- `t3code.service` to be active
- `sshd.service` to be active

If any probe fails, it switches back, adds or updates a marked health-gate
comment on the PR, and exits unsuccessfully.

After the health gate passes, it publishes the deployed closure:

```sh
attic push cache:fleet /run/current-system
```

A push failure does not roll back the healthy switch, but it fails the
service so the timer goes red.

Manual operation:

```sh
ssh pewter 'sudo systemctl status flake-deployer.timer'
ssh pewter 'sudo systemctl start flake-deployer.service'
ssh pewter 'sudo systemctl status flake-deployer.service --no-pager'
ssh pewter 'sudo journalctl -u flake-deployer.service -n 100 --no-pager'
```

Completion requires `status=0/SUCCESS`, an active timer, and successful
health probes in the service journal. A successful `nixos-rebuild` alone is
not sufficient evidence.

## Watchdog

The Watchdog checks the newest commit touching `flake.lock`. It runs on the
1st of each month and can also be dispatched manually:

```sh
gh workflow run update-watchdog
gh run list --workflow update-watchdog --limit 1
gh run watch <run-id> --exit-status
```

The required evidence is a completed run with conclusion `success` and a
recent-lock message. A failure means the Updater may be stale even if both
systemd timers still exist.

## Recovery And Evidence

For a failed update or deployment, collect evidence in this order:

1. `gh pr view <number>` and `gh pr checks <number>`.
2. The failed Build gate job log, if applicable.
3. `systemctl status` and `journalctl` for the relevant pewter service.
4. The current and previous NixOS generations if a switch occurred.
5. Watchdog status and the last `flake.lock` commit age.

Do not bypass the Build gate to deploy an unverified revision. If a service
change is needed, send it through a pull request and wait for every `build <host>` check
before retrying the Deployer.

## Host Changes

When adding a host, update the Build gate matrix and the GitHub ruleset's
required checks in addition to the NixOS host declarations. Follow
`docs/agents/adding-a-host.md`; all of these are part of the verification
invariant:

- One `- host:` row in the `build-closure` matrix, plus `build <host>` in the
  ruleset's required checks.
- One `hosts.<host>` record in `modules/fleet.nix`.
- The `checks (x86_64-linux)` and `checks (aarch64-linux)` jobs need no
  per-host edits — the step enumerates every check via `nix eval ... --apply builtins.attrNames` — but both must
  stay required in the ruleset or the registry and profile checks stop gating.

The `build-matrix-sync` check fails the gate when the matrix rows and the
`nixosConfigurations` keys drift in either direction.
